# IAM Policy Document Catalog
This repository is a community sourced collection of example IAM policy documents for AWS, GCP, and Azure maintained by the team at IAM Pulse. The catalog is browsable on the web at: [https://www.iampulse.com/policies](https://www.iampulse.com/policies) 

## Browsing the Catalog
Navigate through the examples within each cloud provider. Each policy example is in its own directory, with a corresponding `policy.json` file and README. Some policies may contain variables, which will be explicitly mentioned in each README. Variables are defined by the format `{{varname}}` and should be substituted for your own environment.

- [Amazon Web Services](aws/)
- [Google Cloud Platform](gcp/)
- [Microsoft Azure](azure/)

## Contributing to the Catalog
If you'd like to contribute an example policy of your own, submit a pull request to this repository. We'll review it and publish on the [IAM Pulse website](https://www.iampulse.com) with your profile attributed. If you're not already a member of the IAM Pulse Community, you can sign up for free [here](https://www.iampulse.com/signup).

For each policy, provide a `policy.json` file in the format of the respective cloud provider, along with a README that describes the type of policy and how to implement it.
